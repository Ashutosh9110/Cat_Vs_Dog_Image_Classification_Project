# Cat_Vs_Dog_Image_Classification_Project

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat.

Our basic task is to create an algorithm to classify whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The input for this task is images of dogs or cats from training dataset, while the output is the classification accuracy on test dataset.
